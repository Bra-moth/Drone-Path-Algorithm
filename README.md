# Drone-Path-Algorithm
Creating an algorithm for an autonomous drone that detects moving objects and performs actions based on instructions involves multiple steps, including object detection, decision-making, and controlling the drone's movement. Below is a high-level breakdown of the steps to achieve this functionality
